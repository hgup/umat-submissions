This C project solves a system of linear equations.

//run the makefile

Takes following things as input:
1. The number of equaitons should be given as the input
2. The coefficient and resultant matrices 
Gives the solution vector as output.

Eg:
Enter the size of the matrix: 3
Enter the coefficient matrix:
1 2 1
2 2 3
-1 -3 0
Enter the resultant vector:
0
3
2
The solution vector is: [1.00, -1.00, 1.00]
