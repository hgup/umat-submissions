# RSA algorithm in C

## Overview
This program will encrypt and decypt a file using the RSA algorithm.

## Usage
    First, put the files you need to encrypt into this folder and run make command.

    Next run the executable file.

    There when you encrypt, store your public and private key securely.
    If you lose it you wont be able to decrypt it back.
    After giving out public and private keys, press any key and it will vanish from the terminal.

    Here you can also pass multiple files at once through command line and encrypt or decrypt them all at once. 

Encrypted file is named as filename_encrypted.txt 

Decrypted file is named as filename_decrypted.txt
