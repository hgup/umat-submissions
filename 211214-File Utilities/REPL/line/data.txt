Logic to replace specific line in a text file
Step by step descriptive logic to replace specific line with another in a text file.

Open source file in read mode, store its reference to fPtr.
Create and open a temporary file with name replace.tmp, store its reference to fTemp.
Input line number to replace in file from user. Store it in some variable say line.
Input new line from user to replace with, store it in newline.
Initialize a count variable with 0.
Read a line from file and store it in buffer.
Increment count by 1.
If count == line, then current line should be replaced with newline. Means if (count == 0) then write newline to fTemp, otherwise write buffer to fTemp.
Repeat step 6-8 till end of file.
Finally close all files.
Delete the original source file and rename temporary fTemp file path as of source file.
